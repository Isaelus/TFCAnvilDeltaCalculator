# How am I supposed to use this app?

This app will not guarantee that you will get a perfectly forged item! You need to align the green and red ticks on the anvil.

## Why do I need to align those markers?

On certain forges, the red tick is not always fixed and can be random.

## This code sucks...

Yea, it works though and its a small application so speed is not really the goal.
